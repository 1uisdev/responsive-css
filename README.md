# responsive-css

This project took me 2 weeks. OMG
for me, it's kinda difficult to learn positioning with float and flexbox.. a friend helped me on it.
I had some trouble with the "divs" size, that i couldn't solve it alone. GLAD that i could finish it.

hope you like it, too!!!


the objective of this project, is to show you the responsiveness of the browser window in different sizes, as a desktop, or mobile.
